# Unfocus

A tool to help cut down on time spent on Twitter, reading the news, etc.

## To use

1. Edit `sites.txt` with the sites you would like to spend less time on
1. Run `sudo unfocus.sh`

## How it works

A popular trick to prevent visiting a website is to convince your computer that its domain resolves to localhost. This can be done by manually editing the /etc/hosts file:

    127.0.0.1    site-you-do-not-want-to-visit.com

The problem is that, if you ever want a little taste of what you're missing, you have to manually edit again to unblock and remember to edit _again_ when you're ready to re-block...

Anyway, this tool tries to do that for you.

### Is that okay?

Your computer's hosts file is sensitive and write-protected. That's why you need to `sudo` to run this script. That's also why a backup is made and saved to a local `backups` folder on each run -- you canÂ manually revert if something should go wrong.

## TODO

* Warn if it's already running somewhere else
* Fail loudly if hosts file can't be edited
* Enable variable "minutes to wait"
* Cull backups after N files
